* How stoic is static pointers ?

  We want to know under what condition static pointers remain the
  same. In this repository we have a simple executable that prints a
  static pointer. We would like to know in what contexts the value of
  the static pointer changes.

  With each change, we mention what is the output for a given run of
  the executable.

** TODO Assuming the source does not change

   We assume that the source is exactly the same.

- [X] Multiple compilation does not change static ptrs

  git version 2fa03b6214691529875d59d80407e846652e13fe
      gives me 3e1241819ab6d1a7f6669a9e78ccf059

- [X] Adding comments/spurious etc does not change.

  For example git version 96a0b230df6f1a5f3508e1604381860c7d394ce8
  continues to give me the output 3e1241819ab6d1a7f6669a9e78ccf059

- [ ] On different architectures gives same value
